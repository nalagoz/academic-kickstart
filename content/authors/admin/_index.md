As a Ph.D. student at the Department of Marketing at Tilburg University (since September 2019), I empirically investigate the market for digital music and streaming services under the supervision of [Hannes Datta](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/staff/h-datta) and [George Knox](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/staff/g-knox).  In my first essay, I assess how artists' adoption of streaming services (i.e., the fact that artists start releasing music on Spotify) affects subsequent music production.

I hold a Research Master's Degree in Quantitative Marketing from Tilburg University (2019), and a B.A. in Economics from Koç University (2018).
